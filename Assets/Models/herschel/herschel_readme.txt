ADD-ON INFO
Herschel uses a "lissajous" orbit around the Sun-Earth L2 point. The .xyz trajectory file used in this add-on was extracted from JPL Horizons data, in an Earth-centered reference frame. Sample rate is every 3 hours. the .ssc file included will maintain Herschel's solar panels pointed toward the Sun, while the x-axis points along the velocity vector relative to Earth.
